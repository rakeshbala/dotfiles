# dotfiles
My dotfiles repository.

`bootstrap.sh` sets it up for a functional zsh environment with a useful vimrc, tmuxconf, convenient aliases, better themes and some cool plugins for zsh.

* Install brew (linuxbrew or homebrew according to the environment)
* Uses antigen for zsh plugin management
* Uses vim-plug for vim plugin management
* Adds a .dotfilepath file to $HOME directory
